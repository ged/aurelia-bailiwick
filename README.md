# Aurelia-Bailiwick

A collection of utilities and classes for using the Bailiwick domain model
toolkit under the Aurelia framework.

It's based heavily on the aurelia-breeze adapter by Jeremy Danyow 
(github.com/jdanyow). Many thanks for his excellent examples, comments
in the Aurelia Gitter.im channel, and blog posts about Aurelia binding.
